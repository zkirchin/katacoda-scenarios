## Check for Rails

Let's ensure you have rails installed, go ahead and run `rails -v`{{execute}}

Did you get a version number? Great!

If not, let's run `gem install rails`{{execute}}

## Create your First App

Ok, so now we have Rails installed. Let's create our first application. We'll start by laying the foundation for a local pizza shop ordering system.

We'll create our app and call it ZacksZas. We do this by running `rails new ZacksZas`{{execute}}

As you'll see, rails is building a new application for you and installing the necessary packages along with the creation.
